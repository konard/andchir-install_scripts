- The bash script must be adapted for Ubuntu 24.04.
- The bash script must create the installer_user user itself and switch to it.
- The script should install and configure everything necessary, including, for example, a web server, if required.
- The domain name or other required data must be set through arguments when running the script.
- The script must create an SSL certificate for the domain using certbot.
- There should be no additional questions or confirmations.
- When necessary, clone the git repository, and if it already exists in the home directory, then pull updates.
- Always do `git checkout .` before pull to discard local changes.
- Script must support idempotency.
- All actions must have checks, for example, if you need to create a database, you need to check if it exists, if it exists, skip it. The script can be run multiple times, on repeated runs the code should be updated, but not the database, etc.
- If a systemd service already exists, restart should be run for it.
- If python is used and the virtual environment directory already exists, you should not create a new one, but only update dependencies in this virtual environment.
- If you need to create a database for a specific piece of software, never use the root password and user, create a new user and a new password if you don't have one yet.
- In the nginx configuration, always specify that separate log files should be created for the domain.
- If an SSL certificate has already been created, it should not be recreated and the nginx configuration should not be updated.
- All passwords that the script creates must be secure. They need to be written in the report.
- Installation information should be nicely formatted using colors for text.
