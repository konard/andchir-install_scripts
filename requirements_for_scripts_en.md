- The Bash script must be adapted for Ubuntu 24.04.
- The Bash script must automatically create the installer_user user and perform actions on its behalf.
- The script must install and configure all required components, including the web server (if required).
- The required data must be specified via arguments when running the script (for example, the domain name, if necessary).
- The script must create an SSL certificate for the domain using certbot.
- There should be no additional questions or confirmations.
- If necessary, the script must clone the Git repository, and if it already exists in the home directory, perform an update (pull).
- Before performing a pull, always execute `git checkout .` to discard local changes.
- The script must support idempotency.
- All actions must include a check for resource existence. For example, when creating a database, it must be checked to see if it exists, and if so, skip this step. The script can be run multiple times: when run again, the code should be updated, but not the database or other existing resources.
- If the systemd service already exists, you must run the restart command for it.
- If Python is used and the virtual environment directory already exists, do not create a new one; updating the dependencies in the existing virtual environment is sufficient.
- If you need to create a database for specific software, never use the root password and root user. Create a new user with a new password and access rights to only one database.
- The Nginx configuration should always specify the creation of separate log files for the domain.
- If an SSL certificate has already been created, do not recreate it or update the Nginx configuration.
- All passwords generated by the script must be secure and recorded in the log.
- The installation information should be attractively formatted using text colors.
